**A Multi Agent Developer Platform**

MultiDev is a collaborative platform designed to streamline the workflow of developers working in a multi-agent environment. It provides an integrated ecosystem where developers can manage projects, coordinate code changes, and leverage both client and server functionalities for a seamless development experience.

This project is aimed at providing a responsive and intuitive platform to enhance productivity and collaboration among developers.

## Features

- **Collaborative Environment:** Work together with multiple agents in real time.
- **Intuitive UI:** Clean and responsive user interface to manage projects and code.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to handle growing teams and complex applications.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clearly divided client and server components for modular development.

## Technologies Used

- **Client:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Server:** Node.js (assumed; adjust as necessary)
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub
